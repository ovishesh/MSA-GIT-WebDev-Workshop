# Front-end

Breif overview of HTML, JS, and CSS.

## Template

For this session we'll be downloading a template from http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/ rather than creating a brand new site from scratch.

The template we'll be using can be found here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-frontpage/

1. Navigate to http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-frontpage/ and click 'Download'.

2. Once that's finished downloading go ahead and unzip it the contents. You should have a css, js and font folder along with a index.html file.
