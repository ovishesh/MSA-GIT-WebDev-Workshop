# Front-end

Breif overview of HTML, JS, and CSS.

## Template

For this session we'll be downloading a template from http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/ rather than creating a brand new site from scratch.

The template we'll be using can be found here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-frontpage/

1. Navigate to http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-frontpage/ and click 'Download'.

2. Once that's finished downloading go ahead and unzip it the contents. You should have a css, js and font folder along with a index.html file.

3. Open index.html in your browser and have a quick look around.

## HTML

1. Open up index.html in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred text editor).

You should see something like this:

You should see at the top your opening ```<html>``` tag. Within that tag you have two children elements, a ```<head>``` and a ```<body>``` tag.

Your ```<head>``` element is where you'll define your page title, reference your css style sheet and javascript files, and any other meta data pertaining to your page.

Inside your ```<body>``` tags is where you'll set out the structure of your page including titles, text paragraphs, tables, forms, images, etc.
